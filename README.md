In type II phase matching configuration, an extraordinary gate beam and an ordinary pump beam are directed inside the BBO crystal to generate an extraordinary sum frequency light beam.
The optical axis of the BBO is in the plane defined by gate beam and pump beam.
The optimal phase-matching condition is achieved by rotating the BBO while keeping the optical axis of BBO remaining inside the plane defined by gate beam and pump beam.
Thus, the to find out the turning angle of the BBO, the program takes 4 inputs: 
  1. angle between pump beam and gate beam
  2. The internal cut angle of the BBO cyrstal
  3. gate beam wavelength
  4. pump beam wavelength
The output of the program will be the turning angle of the BBO for the optimal phase-matching condition.
The program also takes into account of two BBO installations, namely case A and case B. The schematic representation is given in caseA_caseB.PNG. This nomenclature is from the publication:
